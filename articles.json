Bettman said the league is starting to move\u00a0away from a single-city, neutral-site solution to a different format where the league would have four bubble cities with full professional facilities. Ideally, Bettman said the league would be able to complete the regular season\u00a0and proceed with a normal playoff format. One issue with that plan would be that the draft is typically a busy time for player movement, but trading before the playoffs would be problematic. If the NHL is able to return from its pandemic-induced pause, Gary Bettman says it will be \"on some basis that is fair and has integrity.\" \"We're modelling, we're trying to see what our options will be under whatever scenario unfolds.", "article_type": "sports"},
